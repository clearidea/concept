# Concept

Concept is a minimal MVC framework (although it includes nothing related to models).

Much like rails, views can automatically rendered using different extensions in the route:

/user/1<br>
/user/1.json<br>
/user/1.xml<br>

It is built on top of the [Neuron](http://github.com/clearidea/neuron) components.
